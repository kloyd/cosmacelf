Kelly,

	Once you understand the "just" of SCRT, it is very handy to use it.
Basically it is as follows:
R4 points to the "CALL" routine
R5 points to the "RETURN" routine
Your Program counter has to be R3
The format most used is:
SEP	R4	
DW	XXXX

The SEP R4 calls the "CALL" routine and transfers the program execution
pointed to by the "DW" value with PC=R3
Then to return to the calling program your subroutine just uses a SEP R5
instruction to return. Once you get the idea
Of using it, it is a piece of cake to understand.

If you need any help, just let me know.

The Monitor "INPUT" routine is at 8005hex in the ORG'ed 8000hex Monitor
The inputted character is returned in RB.0

The Monitor "OUTPUT" routine is at 821Dhex in the ORG'ed 8000hex Monitor
The character to be outputted is stored in RB.0
NOTE: In the 11 July 2023 update, this address contain a jump to address
8100hex which is where the updated OUTPUT routine is stored at

The "OUTSTR" routine is at 8526hex which outputs a string of characters
until it is terminated by a 00hex value

Using SCRT:
To call the "INPUT" routine your source code should be
SEP	R4
DW	8005H

To call the "OUTPUT" routine your source code should be
SEP	R4
DW	821DH

To call the "OUTSTR" routine your source code should be
SEP	R4
DW	8526H
NOTE: R7 points to the string to output and the string must be terminated by
a 00H byte
